Crypto Twitter Influencer Fantasy Trading (like fantasy.top – users buy/sell "cards" of X influencers, prices move with their engagement)Prompt: "Build a full onchain mini-app for Base + Farcaster where users buy/sell tokenized 'cards' of popular crypto Twitter influencers. Card prices fluctuate in real-time based on the influencer's likes/reposts/follower growth over the last 24h/7d. Include daily/weekly tournaments with prize pools, leaderboards, and easy sharing of portfolios. Use bonding curves for liquidity, integrate with Base App for seamless USDC trades, add social features like challenging friends. Make it addictive with streaks and notifications."

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values to match the new app concept.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a sleek, modern bird silhouette intertwined with a cryptocurrency symbol, surrounded by dynamic lines and dots that represent likes, reposts, and follower growth. The design uses a bold blue and gold color palette against a clean white background, conveying energy, connectivity, and the fusion of social media and blockchain technology. The bird is positioned to the left, the crypto symbol to the right, with subtle motion lines indicating real‑time engagement metrics.
